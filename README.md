## How does it work
Four birds names are choosen randomly from the [IOC database](http://www.worldbirdnames.org/). Then, one of them is choosed and a random audio is retrieved from [Xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org).

## Acnowledgment
A big thanks to [IOC World Bird List](http://www.worldbirdnames.org/) for the list of bird names and [Xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org) for the bird recordings.
