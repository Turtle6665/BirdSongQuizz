BirdSongQuizz is a simple quizz game where you have to gess the right bird based on it's song. You can choose between a variaty of language for the bird names. You can also pick regions you want to include in you game.

Go to [the webpage](https://turtle6665.github.io/BirdSongQuizz/webpages/quizz.html) to see and play the simple game.

## How does it work
Four birds names are choosen randomly from the [IOC database](http://www.worldbirdnames.org/) based on the regions you selected. Then, one of them is choosed and a random audio is retrieved from [Xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org).

## Acnowledgment
A big thanks to [IOC World Bird List](http://www.worldbirdnames.org/) for the list of bird names and [Xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org) for the bird recordings.
